# dbt+elementary test pipeline

This is a practice dbt+elementary pipeline meant for learning purposes.

Steps to execute:

1. Set up postgreSQL.

docker compose up -d
```

2. Create the .env file from the example one and run the script to export the environment variables.
```
source scripts/source-env 
```

3. Install dependencies with poetry.
```
poetry install
source scripts/source-env 
```

4. Check dbt connection status.
```
cd dbt_pipeline
poetry run dbt debug
```

5. Install dbt deps.
```
poetry run dbt deps
```

6. Run dbt
```
poetry run dbt build
```

7. Execute elementary report
```

8. To see the data generated by dbt, you can use the DB client of your preference and create a connection using the db credential you'll find in the profiles.yml file.
